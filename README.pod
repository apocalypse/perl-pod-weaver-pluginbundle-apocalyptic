=head1 NAME

Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Apocalyptic - Let the apocalypse generate your POD!

=head1 VERSION

  This document describes v0.004 of Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Apocalyptic - released October 23, 2014 as part of Pod-Weaver-PluginBundle-Apocalyptic.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In your F<weaver.ini>:

	[@Apocalyptic]

Or alternatively, in your L<Dist::Zilla> dist's F<dist.ini>:

	[PodWeaver]
	config_plugin = @Apocalyptic

This plugin bundle formats your POD and adds some sections and sets some custom options. Naturally, in order for
most of the plugins to work, you need to use this in conjunction with L<Dist::Zilla>.

It is nearly equivalent to the following in your F<weaver.ini>:

	[@CorePrep]			; setup the pod stuff
	[-SingleEncoding]		; add the =encoding command to your Pod
	[Region / Pod::Coverage]	; move any Pod::Coverage markers to the top ( =for Pod::Coverage foo bar )
	[-StopWords]			; gather our stopwords and add some extra ones via Pod::Weaver::Plugin::StopWords

	[Name]				; automatically generate the NAME section
	[Version]			; automatically generate the VERSION section
	format = This document describes v%v of %m - released %{LLLL dd, yyyy}d as part of %r.
	is_verbatim = 1

	[Generic / SYNOPSIS]		; move the SYNOPSIS section here, if it exists
	[Generic / DESCRIPTION]		; move the DESCRIPTION section here ( it is required to exist! )
	required = 1

	; get any POD marked with our special types and list them here
	[Collect / ATTRIBUTES]
	command = attr
	[Collect / METHODS]
	command = method
	[Collect / FUNCTIONS]
	command = func
	[Collect / POE Events]
	command = event

	[Leftovers]			; any other POD you use

	[SeeAlso]			; generate the SEE ALSO section via Pod::Weaver::Section::SeeAlso
	[Support]			; generate the SUPPORT section via Pod::Weaver::Section::Support ( only present in main module )
	irc = irc.perl.org, #perl-help, Apocalypse
	irc = irc.freenode.net, #perl, Apocal
	irc = irc.efnet.org, #perl, Ap0cal
	email = APOCAL
	[Authors]			; automatically generate the AUTHOR(S) section
	[Contributors]			; automatically generate the CONTRIBUTOR(S) section via Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ContributorsFromGit
	[Generic / ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS]	; move the ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS section here, if it exists
	[Legal]				; automatically generate the COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE section
	[WarrantyDisclaimer]		; automatically generate the DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY section via Pod::Weaver::Section::WarrantyDisclaimer

	[-Transformer]
	transformer = List		; mangle all :list pod into proper lists via Pod::Elemental::Transformer::List
	[-EnsureUniqueSections]		; sanity check your sections to make sure they are unique via Pod::Weaver::Plugin::EnsureUniqueSections

If you need something to be configurable ( probably the Support section, ha! ) please let me know and I can add it in a future version.

=head1 Future Plans

=head2 auto image in POD?

=begin :HTML <p><img src="http://www.perl.org/i/icons/camel.png" width="600">Perl Camel!</p>
=end :HTML

Saw that in http://search.cpan.org/~wonko/Smolder-1.51/lib/Smolder.pm

Maybe we can make a transformer to automatically do that? ( =image http://blah.com/foo.png )

<jhannah> Apocalypse: ya, right? cool and dangerous and prone to FAIL as URLs become invalid... :/
<jhannah> I'd hate to see craptons of broken images on s.c.o   :(
<Apocalypse> Yeah jhannah it would be best if you could include the image in the dist itself... but that's a problem for another day :)
<jhannah> Apocalypse: it'd be trivial to include the .jpg in the .tgz... but what's the POD markup for that? and would s.c.o. do it correctly?
<jhannah> =begin HTML is ... eep
<Apocalypse> I think you could do it via sneaky means but it's prone to breakage
<Apocalypse> i.e. include it in dist as My-Foo-Dist/misc/image.png and link to it via s.c.o's "browse dist" directory
<Apocalypse> i.e. link to http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/WONKO/Smolder-1.51/misc/image.png
<Apocalypse> I should try that sneaky tactic and see if it works =]
